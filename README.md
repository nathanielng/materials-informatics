# Materials Informatics

This is a repository to keep track of materials informatics efforts.

## Summary

1. [`APIs.md`](https://github.com/nathanielng/materials-informatics/blob/master/APIs.md): API access to cloud-hosted Material Databases
2. [`HIGH_THROUGHPUT_DFT.md`](https://github.com/nathanielng/materials-informatics/blob/master/HIGH_THROUGHPUT_DFT.md): databases generated via high throughput DFT frameworks, as well as associated code for generating data via high throughput computation.
3. [`MODELS.md`](https://github.com/nathanielng/materials-informatics/blob/master/MODELS.md): models for materials informatic predictions

**Note**: this list is a work in progress and there are other similar initiatives (listed below).
